# histogram_scaling
We have a finished working desktop application.  It controls a camera and turntable for shooting images used in "360 product views" and Photogrammetry.  Our histogram works well for most images. However for images that are mostly white and have little subject the portion of the histogram that represents that subject is so minimal that it does not show up visually in the graph. Looks like a scaling issue.  This is our issue.  The bounty is for any approved developer to provide us with a DLL to "re-create" a typical histogram one would find on the back of a DSLR camera. Or any consumer digital camera that has a histogram displayed.  The DLL should allow for or accommodate for the following:  1/ Allow the aspect ratio of the displayed histogram to be set, within reason, by the developer using the DLL  2/ Display luminance as most digital cameras do,  3/ Option to display RBG  Interested person should apply via the https://github.com/pamcoimaging/histogram_scaling.git web stite.  Thank you.
